# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview 
Alphabet Soup is a non-profit, philanthropic foundation that donates to other organizations to help better the world and well being of all Earth's inhabitants. Alphabet Soup wants to ensure that their donations are impactful and to avoid funding ineffective organizations. A binary classifier was designed and used to help analyze and decide whether applicants will be successful in their proposed goals if funded by Alphabet Soup. 
Alphabet Soup has donated to over 34,000 organizations in the past 20 years. This data comes from the charity_data.csv and was preprocessed and then used to train and test the neural network model. There are 9 features to this training data and 1 target variable. In order to optimize this model, a variety of techniques were used which will be discussed in detail below.
